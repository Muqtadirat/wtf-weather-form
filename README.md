# Weather App

## Task: Build a Simple Weather App
Instructions:
Build a basic weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app should have the following features:

City Input:
Include an input field where users can enter the name of a city.

The input field should have an associated "Get Weather" button.

Weather Display:
Display the current temperature and weather condition for the entered city.
You can use a free weather API for this task or hard code the weather data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).

Error Handling:
Handle cases where the entered city is not found or the API request fails (or not found in your hard coded data).
Display a simple error message in such cases.

Simple Styling:
Apply basic styling to make the app visually appealing.
